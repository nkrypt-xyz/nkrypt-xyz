Overview

nkrypt is a fully self-hosted application. All data stays on your device or on servers you control. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to third parties.

Data Collection

We collect no data. The nkrypt application and server run entirely on infrastructure you control. Your files, passwords, and encryption keys never leave your environment unless you explicitly configure remote sync to your own server.

Local Data

All data created by the app (encrypted buckets, preferences, etc.) is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data.

Third-Party Services

The application does not integrate with any analytics, advertising, or third-party tracking services.

Changes

This policy may be updated. Continued use of the application constitutes acceptance of the current policy.
